# Bio---Codon-tables-and-amino-acid-letter-converters
 program convert sequence information between different amino acid representations. This includes the 3-letter codon code (RNA and DNA), the one letter amino acid code and the 3-letter amino acid code

The program will use different dictionaries that represent : codon tables – one for DNA and the other for RNA, and amino acid letter representation converters.
converter asks for and collects a single input string using input() parses the string, looks up the information in the appropriate dictionary, and outputs the correct conversion,

For example:

if I enter “ATG” (without quotes), then the program will output: ATG = MET

if I enter “UAG” (without quotes), then the program will output: UAG = ---

if I enter “E” (without quotes), then the program will output: E = GLU

if I enter “Asp” (without quotes), then the program will output: ASP = D
